# Data Engineering Nanodegree Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

This solution comprises an ETL pipeline built in Python that extracts and transforms data from JSON files and loads them into a database named `sparkifydb`

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset

Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

```javascript
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.

## Database Schema for Song Play Analysis

The star schema was built and optimized for queries on song play analysis. It includes the following tables:

### Fact Table

**songplays**: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

    songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

**users**: users in the app
        
    user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
**songs**: songs in music database
    
    song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
**artists**: artists in music database
    
    artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
**time**: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    
    start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


## Steps to reproduce

The solution was built using Python 3.8.5 and all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
To install them, you can run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test it, you can create the database using docker-compose.yaml by running the following command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will create a database named studentdb.
Next, you will need to run the following command to create the database `sparkifydb` and all the tables used by the ETL pipeline:

```
python create_tables.py
```

The ETL pipeline processes all json files in the `data` folder and inserts them into `sparkifydb`
